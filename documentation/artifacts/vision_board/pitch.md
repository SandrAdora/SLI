🚀 Pitch Summary:

 Communication App for Deaf & Hard‑of‑Hearing Individuals
We’re building a next‑generation communication platform designed to bridge the gap between deaf, hard‑of‑hearing, and hearing individuals — across ages, cultures, and everyday situations. Our web‑based app delivers real‑time, accessible, and intuitive communication tools that empower users from age 10 to 99.

At its core, the app provides real‑time speech‑to‑text with under 300 ms latency, supporting English and German at launch. It also includes full ASL sentence recognition, triggered only when the user taps a button, ensuring privacy and control. For output, the app features ASL avatar animations, making conversations more natural and expressive. Future versions will expand into text‑to‑speech, additional spoken languages like Hungarian, and sign languages like BSL.

The experience is built for real‑world use: one‑on‑one chats, group conversations, professional settings, and even emergencies. Users get color‑coded speaker identification, conversation history, and quick‑access emergency and everyday phrases. The interface is optimized for one‑handed use, with high‑contrast visuals and haptic feedback to ensure accessibility for all.

Under the hood, we use a hybrid processing model — combining on‑device speed with cloud‑powered accuracy — while keeping user privacy front and center. Optional user accounts allow syncing preferences and history securely.

We’re launching with English text translation and ASL support, but the architecture is built for global expansion. Our long‑term vision includes partnerships with schools, hospitals, and accessibility organizations, and an open‑source foundation to encourage community innovation.

This isn’t just an app — it’s a communication bridge, a learning tool, and a step toward a more inclusive world.
